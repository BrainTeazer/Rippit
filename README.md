## About

The project is built using **PHP** backend and plain **Javascript/HTML/CSS**.
It also uses **MySQL** and **MongoDB**.

Currently, the project implements post types, post rating, post sorting, user authentication, tickets (feedback, reports), and search suggestions.

The project also utilizes data definition languages to implement the entity-relationship model and query-dependent access rights using sanitized SQL queries for enhanced security and efficient data retrieval and analysis.

## Notes

Due to the database used being hosted on clamV servers, which is only accessible at Constructor University (formerly known as Jacobs University Bremen) or using the University VPN, the backend logic is not fully functional without the VPN.
